# customer_churn_prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a data pipeline for predicting customer churn using machine learning. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation to identify factors contributing to customer attrition.

## Project Workflow

### Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling and transformation

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization to understand patterns and trends
- Correlation analysis between features and churn

### Modeling
- Implemented various machine learning models including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Neural Networks
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance

### Model Evaluation
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC AUC
- Feature importance analysis
- Cross-validation to ensure robustness

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains customer-related features such as demographics, account activity, and service usage.

## Results & Insights

### Key Findings
1. **Feature Importance**: The analysis revealed that certain features, such as customer tenure, monthly charges, and service usage patterns, were highly influential in predicting churn. For example, customers with shorter tenures and higher monthly charges were more likely to churn.
   
2. **Model Performance**: 
   - The **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** models outperformed others, achieving an accuracy of over 90% and an F1-score of 0.88.
   - The **ROC AUC score** for the best model was 0.92, indicating strong predictive power in distinguishing between churn and non-churn customers.

3. **Churn Drivers**: 
   - Customers without long-term contracts were more likely to churn.
   - High monthly charges without corresponding value-added services were a significant churn driver.
   - Lack of engagement with customer support also correlated with higher churn rates.

4. **Business Insights**:
   - Retention strategies should focus on improving customer satisfaction for high-risk groups, such as offering discounts or personalized services.
   - Proactive engagement with customers showing signs of disengagement (e.g., reduced service usage) can help reduce churn.

## Use Cases

### 1. **Customer Retention Strategies**
   - **Targeted Offers**: Identify high-risk customers and offer them tailored discounts, upgrades, or loyalty rewards to encourage retention.
   - **Personalized Communication**: Use churn predictions to send personalized emails or notifications to customers likely to leave, addressing their specific concerns.

### 2. **Product and Service Improvements**
   - Analyze churn drivers to identify gaps in service offerings. For example, if customers with high monthly charges are churning, consider introducing more affordable plans or value-added services.
   - Improve customer support for segments with low engagement, ensuring timely and effective resolution of issues.

### 3. **Marketing Campaigns**
   - Focus marketing efforts on retaining high-value customers who are at risk of churning.
   - Use churn predictions to refine customer segmentation and create targeted campaigns for different customer groups.

### 4. **Operational Efficiency**
   - Allocate resources more effectively by prioritizing high-risk customers for retention efforts.
   - Reduce customer acquisition costs by focusing on retaining existing customers rather than acquiring new ones.

### 5. **Subscription-Based Businesses**
   - For businesses with subscription models (e.g., streaming services, SaaS), this pipeline can help predict which customers are likely to cancel their subscriptions, enabling proactive interventions.


## Business Impact
- **Increased Revenue**: By reducing churn, businesses can retain more customers, leading to higher recurring revenue.
- **Improved Customer Satisfaction**: Proactively addressing customer concerns can enhance overall satisfaction and loyalty.
- **Cost Savings**: Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, leading to significant savings in marketing and sales efforts.


## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate real-time data to enable dynamic churn prediction and immediate intervention.
- Expand the model to include additional data sources, such as customer feedback or social media sentiment, for more accurate predictions.
- Develop a dashboard for business stakeholders to monitor churn trends and take actionable insights in real-time.


This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in addressing real-world business challenges, providing actionable insights to reduce customer churn and drive growth.
